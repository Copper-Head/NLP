A chat conversation. B is for Bot, H is for Human.

B: Good day, sir! Can I help you set up an appointment?

H: Yes please. I'd like to set up a meeting tomorrow/today/on monday/next
monday [month]/THE 13th/thirteenth

Time expressions:
date/day = tomorrow, today, a week from now, two or more weeks from now, next
month, weekday, literally "weekend" 

time: at X o'clock, at X thirty/forty etc

month: this month, next month, in X months


some brainstorming:

we could set the event day/date/month based on retrieved system values.
